# MvP
These features are required for a usable first version:
 * External script support - the core of the pipeline, support scripts in Nims.
 * Load state from JSON - through script into the internal state.
 * Process markdown - accessing and changing internal state.
 * Image processing - creating several variants of the same image (see Picturesque and Transfigure under plugins).
 * Post processing - using parcel etc.

# After that
