accelerate - static site generator

Accelerate is a static site generator built on the GNU principle of small,
single purpouse tools working together.

Accelerate doesn't come with a lot built in, not even a templating engine. All
it does is to index all the resources in the provided paths, maintain a shared
context and call the plugins configured in the build config.

In order to do actual work you integrate with external tools. To facilitate this
Accelerate uses nimscript as the layer between the internal state and whatever
tool you want to use.

So to process all your HTML files through Nunjucks you would first have a plugin
that loads all the content into the shared context, then another that would
process each HTML file through Nunjucks and generate HTML with content.

There are several plugins already available for use, and it is easy to write
your own using Accelerates DSL and Nimscript. For more information read the
Github readme: https://github.com/xxxxxx/xxxxxx#readme
